== ngx_http_upstream_hash_module ==

Installation:

    cd nginx-1.1.4 # or whatever
    patch -p1 < /path/to/this/directory/nginx.patch
    ./configure --add-module=/path/to/this/directory
    make
    make install

Usage:

    upstream backend {
        ...
        hash        $request_uri;
        hash_again  10;          # default 0
    }

Works the same on 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

See http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpUpstreamRequestHashModule for more details.

Weibin Yao added a new directive of hash_select_port:

=== hash_select_port ===

'''syntax''' ''hash_select_port low_port high_port''

'''default''' ''none''

'''context''' ''upstream''

The server opens the ports range from low port to high port. This module will choose a port with crc32 hash. The total port number should be smaller than 64.

=== $hash_random_number === 

It's a pseudo random number. It's equal to the current time with millisecond.
